This is a simplified version of the classic Scrabble game implemented for Milestone 1.The game is played via the console, and words can be placed on a 15x15 Scrabble board. The board supports word placement both horizontally and vertically, and the moves are notated in standard Scrabble format (e.g., "WORD xy +score").
